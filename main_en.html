                    I am a <strong>Computer Engineering student</strong> at Birzeit
                    University, currently in my third year. Over the past few years, I
                    have worked on several academic projects, including
                    <strong>Database Management Systems</strong> and
                    <strong>Data Structures</strong>, which have honed my technical and
                    problem-solving skills. I have developed proficiency in
                    <strong>programming languages</strong> such as Python, Java, and C,
                    as well as experience with <strong>hardware platforms</strong> like
                    Arduino and TM4C123G microcontrollers. Additionally, I have
                    cultivated a strong interest in
                    <strong>microcontrollers</strong> and
                    <strong>embedded systems</strong>, which I actively explore as part
                    of my hobbies and personal projects.
